# ðŸ“š Goodreads Book Recommendation System

## Description

This Goodreads Recommendation System allows users to input a link to their Goodreads bookshelf and receive book suggestions based on their existing collection. This system aims to combat overconsumption in the book community by recommending books users already own, rather than suggesting new purchases. 

## Key Technologies Used

- **Web Scraping**: Beautiful Soup (BS4) for extracting data from Goodreads.
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means Clustering for grouping similar books.
- **Text Analysis**: TF-IDF Vectorization and cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.

## Purpose

By leveraging these technologies, the system creates a content-based recommendation engine that helps users discover books they already have in their collection, reducing the tendency to buy new books unnecessarily.
